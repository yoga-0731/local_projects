A childhood game that we used to play in our old mobile phones.  
Designed using Python and TurtleGraphics

**Functionalities**
  - Snake and food blocks are created.
  - If the snake eats the food, the score adds up and is shwn on the screen.
  - If the snake bites its tail, the game ends. If the snake hits the turtle screen, game ends.
  - The high score is recorded in a .txt file. When a new high score is reached, it is also updated.
  - All use and edge cases are handled in this game.
